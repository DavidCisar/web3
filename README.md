## ðŸ§  About

This repository is a **modular, comprehensive knowledge base and resource hub for modern Web3 development** â€” covering everything from frontend dApp frameworks to smart contract security, zero-knowledge proofs, network orchestration, and more.

The goal is to **consolidate key learnings, tools, and reusable templates** to accelerate the development of decentralized applications and systems, while supporting **community collaboration and open-source contributions**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

The repository is organized into self-contained modules:

<p>
web3/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/ # React, Angular, Svelte templates (ethers, wagmi, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ networks/ # Public testnets, private localnets (e.g. Hardhat)
â”œâ”€â”€ nodes
â”œâ”€â”€ oracles/ # Chainlink, Band, custom data feeds
â”œâ”€â”€ protocols/ # Staking, Lending, Voting, Token Standards, DEXs
â”œâ”€â”€ research/ # Papers, references, whitepapers, blog links
â”œâ”€â”€ security/ # Static analysis tools, audit tips, reentrancy patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ smart-contracts/ # Solidity, Vyper, Yul, EVM Assembly, deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ tooling
â”œâ”€â”€ wallets
â”œâ”€â”€ zero knowledge
â””â”€â”€ changelogs/ # Manual + auto-generated logs for each module
</p>
